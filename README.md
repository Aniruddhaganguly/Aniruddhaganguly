# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Aniruddha Ganguly

Iâ€™m currently working as a frontend developer, mostly building e-commerce platforms using **React** and **Next.js**.  

Though I come from an **Electronics and Communication** background, Iâ€™ve always been curious about the web and how things work behind the scenes. While working with APIs on the frontend, I started wondering: *what more can we do with this data?*

That curiosity led me to explore **data engineering** â€” and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m diving into right now.
