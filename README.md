# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aniruddha Ganguly

I'm a frontend developer with a background in Electronics and Communication. I currently build scalable e-commerce platforms using **React** and **Next.js**. 

My journey into APIs sparked a deep curiosity about what we can truly do with data — and that led me to the world of **Data Engineering**. I'm now exploring how to process, transform, and manage data at scale.
